# TreeEditorControl
C# WPF Editor for tree based data.

The main goal was to create a dialog editor for a RPG game,
but this editor can show and edit any tree nodes.

The editor supports basic features like adding/removing nodes,
moving node (inside their node) and undo/redo.

Nodes can be added from the "node catalog" with the toolbar buttons
or per drag & drop. 

The nodes must implement a specific node interface,
but a default implementation (which can be used as a base class) 
is included.
